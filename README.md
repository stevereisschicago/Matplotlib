# Matplotlib

Based on homework feedback have updated code - NEW CODE FILE:  pymaceuticals_starter-Copy2.pyng
**I'VE ATTACHED HOMEWORK FEEDBACK DIRECTLY BELOW, PLEASE SEE MY NOTES**

Hello Steve, 
Thank you for your submission!  You did a great job on this assignment. Keep up your hard work! But, there are a couple of things that didn't work out as expected: 

(1) The summary statistics aren't correct. It should have - mean, median, variance, SEM in a single dataframe.   **CORRECTED**

(2) You should also display any potential outliers in the data if any.  **I HAD DONE AS AN AGGREGATE.  I NOW BROKE OUT BY EACH DRUG AND FOUND ONE OUTLIER (INFUBINOL MOUSE ID = C326)**

(3) The box plot isn't correct. It should have all the treatment regimens on the same plot (including outliers).  	**PARTIALLY DONE - I HAVE BOX PLOTS FOR EACH OF THE FOUR DRUGS, BUT HAVEN'T YET BEEN ABLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCLUDE THEM ALL ON ONE CHART**

(4) The line plot isn't correct. Please check the axes and axis labels.  **CORRECTED**
 
Please try to modify your code if you can.

Homework - KEY OBSERVATIONS

Breakout Data for:  Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, Ceftamin

1) Capomulin and Ramicane have similar results (tumor sizes)
2) Infubinol and Ceftamin have similar results (tumor sizes)
3) Capomulin and Ramicane seem most effective by a significant amount
4) Only one outlier (Inbufol Mouse ID = C326
5) Very strong correlation between mouse size and tumor size with Capomulin
